# Blog App

This is a starter blog built entirely on the django framework. Users will be able to create an account, log into existing accounts, and add new blog posts.

As a beginner blog, this app is still very crude with multiple inefficiencies by way of functionality and design. However, it represents my first steps into the django architectural world.
